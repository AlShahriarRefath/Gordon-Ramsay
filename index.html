        <p class="bold"> In 1998, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was born. The three Michelin star restaurant
            is still in operation and boasts good reviews. For eight years running,
            Restaurant Gordon Ramsay was voted first place in Harden’s.
            I have opened many restaurants and I am set to open 100 more restaurants by 2024.
            Some of the television shows I have been on are Hell’s Kitchen,
            Ramsay’s Kitchen Nightmares, Master Chef, and Hotel Hell.
            In 2007, Gordon Ramsay’s 69% stake in Gordon Ramsay Holdings was estimated to be
            worth $67 million. The number has obviously shot up the roof since.
            In 2017, I entered the Guinness Book of Records by recording the
            ‘Fastest Time to Fillet a 10lb Fish.’ I set the time at one minute and
            fifteen seconds. Later that year, I also set the world record for
            ‘Longest Pasta Sheet Rolled in 60 Seconds.’ The roll was 1.45 meters in length.
